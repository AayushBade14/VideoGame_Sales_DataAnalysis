# Global Video Game Sales Analysis
### This project involves performing data analysis on global video game sales data imported from Kaggle. Using various Python libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), I've analyzed and visualized changing trends over the years, focusing on the most played video game genres and their sales.

# Project Overview
### The primary objective of this project is to explore and understand the trends in video game sales globally. The analysis includes:

## Data Collection: The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, contributed by The Devastator. You can find the dataset here.
## Data Cleaning: Processed the raw data to handle missing values, duplicates, and other inconsistencies.
## Data Analysis and Visualization: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and created visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.
